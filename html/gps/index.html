What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
Semantic tags are things like <table> <form> <article>
The purpose of these tags is to specify a location where you want information to go. helps control pageflow and content control.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
without a css file a browser will just load the html file from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Snippets are something that I can see being very useful especially when we start writing the same blocks of code over and over again just to save us time.


What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? 
Personally I feel the hardest challenge was overall working with my pair. The guide was fantastic and I feel he did an amazing job. personally I just felt like my pairing partner and I just didn't work well together.
