# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 

Version Control is records of changes to a file over time that you can recall. It's useful for reverting files or fixing bugs and to see exactly where something went wrong.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a way for you to work on a project without effecting the main file and allows people to work on different parts of a project without "stepping on each others toes".

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit records the changes that you make to a repository and allows others to see changes that you have made to the project. A good commit message should clearly state what changes you have made so that it is easy and understandable for others.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when your branch and the branch you want to merge into have diverged. Meaning that you have commits in your branch which are not in the branch you want to merge with and vice versa.
