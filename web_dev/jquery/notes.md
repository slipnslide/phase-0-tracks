GOALS :
1. jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours
2. I plan on using code academy as a main resource I feel just to get a basic understanding of jQuery
3. Use google to fill in the gaps for things that I am unsure of.
4. Spend time messing around with whatever already existing code I can find to help me visualize how jQuery looks / functions.
